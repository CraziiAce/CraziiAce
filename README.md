Hi! My name is Teddy, and as you can see, I code stuff.<br>
You can reach me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zwyFZ7h) at **CraziiAce#0001**, or join [my server](https://discord.gg/zwyFZ7h).<br>
My main project is [Starry](https://starrybot.xyz), a bot for Discord with loads of commands including logging, moderation, and reaction roles. You can add it using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=716798638277525535&scope=bot&permissions=8), and I'd really appreciate if you did, as I'm working hard to grow it.
